Fplfriend-api
=============
GraphQL layer on top of the official fantasy premier league api.
This api doesn't include all the data from the official api, but it does include some useful data that I needed for my [fplfriend](https://fplfriend.herokuapp.com) app. You seriously need to check it out, it's awesome, I promiseðŸ˜‰. 

## Getting started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/AustinMusiku/fplfriend-api`
2. Install the dependencies using `yarn install`
3. Copy the contents of the `.env.example` file to a new file named `.env` and fill in the required fields.
4. Run the api using `yarn dev`

The api should now be test it out by visiting [http://localhost:4500/graphql](http://localhost:4500/graphql) in your browser.
